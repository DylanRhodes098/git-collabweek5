Weather Dashboard Project

For this challenge we were assigned into groups. Our group was 'The Frontend Collective'. Consisitng of Dylan, Tom & Emily.

The objective was to create a weather dashboard that integrated an API to fetch weather data in response to a location input.

We started this task by assigning relevant duties to team members, utlising eachother's strengths to create an efficient workflow.

We had the inital task to set up a collaborative GitHub repo, and were mindful to always make updates on branches and perform regular pull requests. Clear communication was a key component of this task. Due to relaying information in our SLack channel, and in our Zoom breakout room, we prevented any merge conflicts.

We adopted a collaborative approach to wireframing, where all group members voiced their opinions on the UX of the dashboard.

Afterwards, we assigned key areas of the challenge to relevant team members as follows:

- Emily: Prototyping, CSS & completion of HTML
- Dylan: API integration, Javascript writing and implementation
- Tom: Skeleton structure of HTML, installation of Bootstrap & testing

The team decided to structure the HTML using Bootstrap, this allowed for the use of components from the Bootstrap library, and also allowed the option to control the appearance of elements in the HTML file itself, resulting in a lesser chance of CSS conflicts. This also ensured a light, clean and simple CSS file.

Overall, this project was a success. The main issue we encountered was when we were presening our project, the API integration didn't work. This was due to the script being linked in the wrong place, which luckily Dylan managed to fix. To prevent this, we should have tested the functionality more rigorously before presenting.
